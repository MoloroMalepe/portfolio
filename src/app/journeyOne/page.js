      My journey into the world of software development wasn&#39;t born from
      early exposure, but rather from a profound fascination with
      technology&#39;s power to tangibly improve our daily lives. Witnessing
      firsthand how lines of code could translate into practical solutions and
      elevate user experiences ignited a passion within me â€“ a desire not just
      to use technology, but to actively shape it.
